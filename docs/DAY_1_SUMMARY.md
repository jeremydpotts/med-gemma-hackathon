- docs/README.md

### 3. Competition Intelligence

**Confirmed Details:**
- **Prize:** $100,000 USD
- **Deadline:** February 24, 2026 (23:59 UTC)
- **Category:** Featured Competition
- **Current Teams:** 0 (we're early!)
- **Status:** We have entered the competition

**Critical Discovery:**
- Competition dataset is currently empty (0 bytes)
- This indicates an **application development challenge**
- Focus is on building innovative tools, not dataset-specific optimization
- Provides flexibility to use public datasets or create demonstrations

## 🔍 Strategic Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Competition Type:** This is NOT a traditional ML benchmarking competition. It's about building human-centered applications with MedGemma.

2. **Data Strategy:** Empty dataset is actually an advantage:
   - Freedom to choose optimal datasets for our use case
   - Can focus on innovation rather than data-specific constraints
   - Can use publicly available medical data
   - Can create synthetic demonstrations

3. **Winning Criteria:** Judges will evaluate:
   - Clinical impact and innovation
   - Application quality and UX
   - Effective use of MedGemma capabilities
   - Professional presentation

4. **Competitive Position:** Being early (0 teams currently) and understanding the challenge type gives us an edge.

### Strategic Advantages Identified

✅ **Clarity** - We understand this is an application challenge
✅ **Flexibility** - Can choose datasets that best showcase our idea
✅ **Speed** - Not waiting for dataset; can move fast on exploration
✅ **Planning** - Comprehensive 37-day roadmap already in place
✅ **Think Tank** - Structured ideation approach from KnovaQuest

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks

1. **Dataset Uncertainty**
   - *Risk:* Competition might release dataset later
   - *Mitigation:* Proceeding with public datasets; monitoring forums daily
   - *Status:* Low concern - competition design suggests no dataset release

2. **Unclear Requirements**
   - *Risk:* Submission format or judging criteria unclear
   - *Mitigation:* Will check forums and contact organizers if needed
   - *Status:* Medium concern - will monitor actively

3. **MedGemma Access**
   - *Risk:* Model access or API issues
   - *Mitigation:* Will test early (Day 2)
   - *Status:* Low concern - Hugging Face provides access

## 🎯 Day 2 Preview

### Goals for Tomorrow (January 14, 2026)

**Morning:**
- Check Kaggle competition forums for updates
- Research publicly available medical datasets
