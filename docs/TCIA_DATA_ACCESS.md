## What is TCIA?

The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is a service which de-identifies and hosts a large archive of medical images of cancer accessible for public download. The data are organized as "collections" defined by a common disease, image modality, or research focus.

**Website:** https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/

## Registration Process

### Step 1: Create TCIA Account

1. Navigate to https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/
2. Click "Create Account" or "Register"
3. Fill out registration form:
   - Name
   - Email (institutional preferred)
   - Organization
   - Country
   - Purpose of use (select "Research" or "Education")

### Step 2: Accept Data Use Agreement

Most TCIA collections require acceptance of a Data Use Agreement (DUA) that includes:
- Commitment to not attempt to identify patients
- Agreement to use data only for stated research purposes
- Acknowledgment of TCIA in publications
- No redistribution of raw data

### Step 3: Download NBIA Data Retriever

TCIA uses the NBIA Data Retriever for large dataset downloads:
1. Download from https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/2QKPBQ
2. Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
3. Requires Java Runtime Environment

## LIDC-IDRI Details (Primary Recommendation)

**Full Name:** Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative

**Why This Collection:**
- Gold standard for lung nodule research
- Includes radiologist annotations
- Multiple time points available for some patients
- Well-documented and widely used
- Perfect for validating 3D nodule detection

**Contents:**
- 1018 thoracic CT scans from 1010 patients
- 7,371 lesions marked as "nodule"
- Expert annotations (4 radiologists per scan)
- DICOM format

**Access:**
1. Go to https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI
2. Accept the Data Use Agreement
3. Use NBIA Data Retriever for download

---

## Sample Download (For Initial Testing)

For quick testing before downloading full collections:

### Option 1: LIDC-IDRI Subset
1. Use NBIA Data Retriever
2. Query for single patient: LIDC-IDRI-0001
3. Download DICOM files (~200-500 MB)

### Option 2: Pre-processed Data
- Kaggle datasets derived from TCIA (smaller, easier access)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images

## Data Format Notes

### DICOM Structure
```
LIDC-IDRI-0001/
├── study_date/
│   ├── series_001/
│   │   ├── 001.dcm
│   │   ├── 002.dcm
│   │   └── ... (100-500 slices)
│   └── series_002/
│       └── ...
```

### Loading in RadAssist Pro
```python
from src.data.loaders import DICOMLoader

loader = DICOMLoader()
volume = loader.load_dicom_series("/path/to/LIDC-IDRI-0001/series/")
```

---

## Compliance Requirements

### Data Handling
- Store downloaded data in `data/raw/tcia/` (gitignored)
- Do not commit DICOM files to repository
- Use only for research/competition purposes

### Attribution
If using TCIA data in publications or demos:
```
Data used in this publication/demonstration were generated by the
National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)
[or appropriate collection citation].
```

### HIPAA Note
- TCIA data is already de-identified
- No additional PHI handling required
- Still follow RadAssist Pro's security protocols for processing

---

## Alternative: Synthetic 3D Data

If TCIA registration is delayed, use synthetic data for 3D testing:

### Option 1: Procedural Generation
Generate synthetic CT volumes with known characteristics for testing pipeline.

### Option 2: Public Non-TCIA Sources
- Grand Challenge datasets: https://grand-challenge.org/
- Medical Decathlon: http://medicaldecathlon.com/
