# Med-Gemma Impact Challenge - Progress Log

## Day 1: January 13, 2026 ✅

### Phase 1: Setup & Data Exploration (Day 1/5)

### Accomplishments

**✅ Project Infrastructure**
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/jeremydpotts/med-gemma-hackathon
- Setup complete directory structure (docs, data, notebooks, src, brainstorming, tests, results, submission)
- Created comprehensive README with project overview
- Added .gitignore for Python, data files, and large files
- Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies

**✅ Data Acquisition**
- Configured Kaggle API (already authenticated)
- Downloaded competition data from Kaggle
- Discovered dataset is currently empty (0 bytes placeholder)
- Created DATA_CATALOG.md documenting data strategy

**✅ Strategic Analysis**
- Analyzed competition type - confirmed it's an application development challenge
- Created DAY_1_STRATEGY_UPDATE.md with revised approach
- Identified that empty dataset provides more freedom for innovation
- Confirmed focus should be on application quality, not dataset-specific metrics

**✅ Documentation**
- Setup docs/ directory with README
- Created data/README.md with download instructions
- Started progress log (this file)
- All initial commits pushed to GitHub

### Key Insights

1. **Competition Type:** Application development challenge, not traditional ML benchmarking
2. **Data Flexibility:** Can use publicly available medical datasets or create demonstrations
3. **Success Criteria:** Innovation, clinical impact, UX quality, effective MedGemma use
4. **Strategic Advantage:** Understanding the challenge type early gives us competitive edge

### Metrics

- **GitHub Commits:** 1 (initial setup)
- **Files Created:** 13
- **Documentation Pages:** 4
- **Schedule Status:** ✅ On track (100% of Day 1 goals achieved)

### Next Steps (Day 2)

1. Check Kaggle competition forums for any updates or clarifications
2. Download sample medical datasets (NIH Chest X-ray subset, MIMIC demo data)
3. Setup MedGemma model access via Hugging Face
4. Create initial exploration notebook to test MedGemma capabilities
5. Begin documenting MedGemma's strengths and limitations

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Empty dataset might mean data release is pending
- **Mitigation:** Proceeding with public datasets; monitoring forums daily

**Risk:** Unclear competition requirements
- **Mitigation:** Will check forums and ask organizers if needed

### Team Morale

🎯 **High confidence.** Day 1 infrastructure complete, strategic clarity achieved, and competitive positioning strong.
