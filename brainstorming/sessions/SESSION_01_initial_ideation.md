### Part 2: Problem Prioritization (30 min)

Rank problems by:
1. **Clinical Impact** - Does it save lives or significantly improve outcomes?
2. **Frequency** - How common is this problem?
3. **Current Gap** - Is there a lack of good solutions?
4. **MedGemma Fit** - Can MedGemma's unique capabilities address this?

**Top-Ranked Problems:**
_To be determined through discussion..._

### Part 3: MedGemma Opportunity Mapping (30 min)

For each top problem, discuss:
- Which MedGemma capability could address it?
- What would the solution look like?
- What makes this different from existing solutions?
- Could we build this in 30 days?

**Opportunity Matrix:**
_To be filled during session..._
